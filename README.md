# Multirate Digital Signal Processing (EE6133) Fall 24

This repository contains the project submissions for the course EE6133 : Multirate Digital Signal Processing  instructed by Prof. R Aravind in the Jul-Nov 2024 semester at IIT Madras. Brief description of each project is provided below -

**Project 1** - Introduction to processing signals at multiple rates, Design of Anti-Aliasing (AA) and Interpolation Filters.

**Project 2a** - Designing a two channel DFT Filter Bank to process signals sampled at 8kHz and 16kHz.

**Project 2b** - Designing a Cosine Modulated Filter Bank (CMFB) to process music signals sampled at 16kHz.
